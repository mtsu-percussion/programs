                            I wrote this arrangement in 2017-2018 for a student of mine who competed in the American Association of Christian Schools National Music Competition during her senior year of high school.  <i>Be Thou My Vision</i> was her favorite hymn.  In April of 2018, she took first place in the Percussion Solo category of the competition with her performance of this arrangement.  The arrangement is structured in a three-part form, with each section in a different key: D, F, and A.  The melody is sometimes stated very clearly, sometimes fragmented, and sometimes implied, but is present throughout.

                            I have always admired the music of Éric Sammut.  He was the first great marimbist I ever saw perform live, and I had the special priviledge of spending a week with him in Paris while gathering research for my dissertation.  I was in the audience at PASIC in 2005 when Sammut premiered the Three Spirals.  The Spirals, like many of his pieces, utilize jazz-inspired harmonies while blending melody and accompaniment in an ideosyncratic style.  While the Spirals can be considered separate pieces (rather than three movements of one larger piece), they nonetheless share motivic and harmonic content, and are considered by Sammut to be 'connected.'

                            Daniel Cathey and I were classmates at Wichita State University.  <i>Forgotten Days of Fall</i> was written while Daniel was studying with Kevin Bobo, before his freshman year at WSU.  The piece was a compositional experiment, an attempt at developing a single melodic idea.  For me the piece evokes a deep sense of nostalgia that I have always found captivating.  It has been a pleasure to revisit this piece after so many years.

                            Paul Osterfield approached me with the idea of composing a timpani solo several years ago, and presented me with a first draft in 2023.  The piece is divided into five contrasting movements, each of which captures a very different mood and color.<br><br>

                            <div class="note-inset">
                                I. This movement features stark contrast between the intense outer material played with mallets, and the subdued textures of hands and brushes.<br><br>

                                II. This mysterious movement makes lyrical use of prepared timpani and many <i>glissandi</i>.  Crotales, cymbals, and prayer bowls are placed on the drums, and are played with various implements to take full advantage of this unique color palette.  <br><br>

                                III. The sustained intensity of the third movement is brought about through the development of short motivic cells and a large number of quick tuning changes.  The middle section takes on a different character, featuring the use of timbale sticks played with loosely bounced strokes and dead strokes.<br><br>

                                IV. This slow movement is played with rolls throughout.  This serves to highlight the lyrical potential of the instrument.<br><br>

                                V. The final, primal movement is energetic, rhythmic, and bombastic at times.  Wooden mallets are used throughout, giving the piece an aggressive, biting sound.

                            Commissioned by William Moersch, <i>Merlin</i> was composed in 1985, and is inspired by Edwin Arlington Robinson's poem of the same name.  The piece is divided into two movements: a slow, foreboding chorale, followed by a faster, rhythmic movement that is "concerned with time and the dissolution of order during time's passage."  An excerpt from Robinson's poem is provided to set the mood for each of the two movements:<br><br>

                            So far beyond the faint edge of the world?<br>
                            D'ye look to see the lady Vivian,<br>
                            Pursued by divers ominous vile demons<br>

                            And hard enough into the feathery west<br>
                            Ye'll have a glimmer of the Grail itself?<br>
                            And if ye look for neither Grail nor lady,<br>
                            What look ye for to see, Gawaine, Gawaine?"<br><br>
